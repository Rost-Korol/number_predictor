# Number predictor

## Model


The model is a simplified version of a convolutional neural network with an architecture similar to VGG, but with only two convolutional blocks. Each block consists of two convolutional layers with ReLU activation in between them, and a MaxPool layer at the output. The data used is a classic dataset commonly used as a benchmark for testing computer vision models - the MNIST dataset, which consists of a collection of handwritten digits.

## GUI 

The graphical user interface is a drawing application implemented using the TKinter framework.
